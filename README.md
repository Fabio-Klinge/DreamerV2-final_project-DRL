## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

The only thing you need to do, is to install all the requirements that are listed in requirements.txt. 
Feel free to use following command inside "DreamerV2" Project.

  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

In this Project "Weights & Biases"(short wandb) is utilized. You can disable it in Parameters.py under _use_wandb_. 

Otherwise you need to create a [wandb account](https://wandb.ai/site) and get your API Key. I can fully recommend it! Besides that we have also included the option to use Tensorboard.
